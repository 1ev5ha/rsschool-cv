## About me 

I have loved the IT industry since childhood. During my school years, I loved creating animations in Macromedia Dremweawer and writing in HTML.<br>
Adulthood has set priorities in its own way.<br>
The main priority is work in the specialty. In the field of industrial construction. Control engineer.<br>
Secondary direction: freelancing, web development on constructors (Tilda, Nethouse), SEO-optimization, advertising. For small and medium businesses.<br>
First, COVID changed the world, burnout at work, and after the military conflict affected my priorities...


Life is one and it is short. It's silly to keep putting things off until later.
